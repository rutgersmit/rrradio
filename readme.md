# Rrradio

The internet lacks a simple web page where you can start a radio stream. So I created one myself. Or actually ChatGPT and Copilot did. Midjourney created the artwork. Thanks guys!

Wishlist: add an option to add stations yourself. Should be stored in local storage or cookies or whatever (ChatGPT/Copilot comes up with).
